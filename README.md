# pytrust

The python package to scrape, transform and analyse data from Trustpilot.

<b>This package is still in development</b>


Package has two main components, scraping scripts, and analysis scripts
1. Scraping - This comprises the collection and cleaning of data
2. Analysis - This includes all analysis, from removing stopwords, NLP modelling, visualisations etc...


### Notes
- You are abe to collect data from multiple companies, then evaluate them together, or separately
	- There are detailed examples of the above two cases in the form of a jupyter notebook

- Data from Trustpilot is publicly accessible (without logging in to the website) at the moment it is collected.
- This package was created for educational purposes.
